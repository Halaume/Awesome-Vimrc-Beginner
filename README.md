# My_vimrc
VIM

My little vim setup with a few remap, hybride line numbers some plugins for C compile errors, theming/displaying whitespace and some colors. + My bonus annoying norme.

If you want to use it just copy the "My_vimrc" file in "~/.vimrc" and put the "colors" directory in "~/.vim/" and you should be good to go ! The first time you lunch it a window should appear and install all the plugins, just let this window do some stuff (it should only take a few seconds / a minute if you are slow) then you should close this window with ":q" and you are good. It may come back in case of update on the plugins.

Made with a lot of CTRL + C into CTRL + V, some tuning by my own, a little time and a lot of hearth <3
