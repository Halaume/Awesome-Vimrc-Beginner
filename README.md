# Awesome vimrc Beginner



VIM

My little vim setup with a few remap, hybride line numbers some plugins for C and C++ compile errors, theming/displaying whitespace and some colors. + My bonus annoying norme (basically normalize tab and auto intend with a little identifiers of col 80 because you just can't have any character after col 80 right?).

If you want to use it just clone it where you want (For quick opening the vimrc file I did it at $(HOME) and named it .vim but you can do what you want), juste add :source \$(WHEREITIS)/.vimrc in your \$(HOME)/.vimrc file. And you should be good to go ! The first time you lunch it a window should appear and install all the plugins, just let this window do some stuff (it should only take a few seconds / a minute if you are slow) then you should close this window with ":q" and you are good. It may come back in case of update on the plugins.

Made with a lot of CTRL + C into CTRL + V, some tuning by my own, a little time and a lot of hearth <3


WARNING !

Keep in mind that your vimrc file is unique and personnal (Also this one is really ugly and not well ordered), you can use mine as a template or to find something you want but there is a very low chance that my vimrc will suit you for real, we will certainly not use the same shortcuts/themes. I still hope you'll fine some interesting thing inside it. Feel free to ask any questions/make recommendation or give me any advices.
